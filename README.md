# GDRIVE Linux

A tool I created to sync my Google Drive to a folder on my PC.

Main features:
  - Uses a recursive algorithm to check cloud and local files.
  - Short sync time, currently just under 4 seconds to sync all platforms (based on my drive with a 150+ files)
  - Automatic, once added as a cron job, you can just drag and drop files like the windows Google Drive client.

Missing features:
  - no support for renaming files currently
  - no support for moving files locally, but moving files on the cloud is supported.
